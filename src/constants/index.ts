I‚Äôve gotten used to how you always have a different and very hilarious outlook on things.
Especially your one-liner: "Check your air fryer brand. I don‚Äôt think it is Kenwood; it is probably KehindeWood."
I mean, who even thinks of that?
Let‚Äôs not even talk about our pronunciation arguments that I ALWAYS WIN, and you‚Äôd never accept I‚Äôm right until
you invite Google into the conversation... bruh, please.
And for the 10 millionth time, it is pronounced "MO-HI-TO" and not "MO-JI-TO".
You should take your comedy career seriously this year üòÇ. In summary,
You make me laugh, and you radiate joy everywhere you go.`,

While you're at it, I'd also need your HR's email ‚Äî we need to renegotiate your employment contract.
The new agreement will be that you get x10 the salary, 6 months paid leave twice a year (don‚Äôt worry, I know what I‚Äôm saying),
accelerated promotion every year, and less work. You‚Äôve tried; you‚Äôre not just another employee, you are truly committed to your work and so damn good at it.
You are dedicated, and the results are there to back it up.
PS: Thanks for helping me collect my money from Salma.
I‚Äôm sure they know I have a seasoned lawyer in my corner.
